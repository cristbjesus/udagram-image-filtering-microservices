# Udagram Image Filtering Application

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into two parts:
1. Frontend - Angular web application built with Ionic Framework
2. Backend RESTful API - Node-Express application

## Getting Started

### Prerequisite
1. The depends on the Node Package Manager (NPM). You will need to download and install Node from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This will allow you to be able to run `npm` commands.
2. Environment variables will need to be set. These environment variables include database connection details that should not be hard-coded into the application code.

### 1. Database
Create a PostgreSQL database either locally or on AWS RDS. The database is used to store the application's metadata.

* We will need to use password authentication for this project. This means that a username and password is needed to authenticate and access the database.
* The port number will need to be set as `5432`. This is the typical port that is used by PostgreSQL so it is usually set to this port by default.

### 2. S3
Create an AWS S3 bucket. The S3 bucket is used to store images that are displayed in Udagram.

### 3. Backend API
Launch the backend API locally. The API is the application's interface to S3 and the database.

* You can visit `http://localhost:8080/api/v0/feed` in your web browser to verify that the application is running. You should see a JSON payload. Feel free to play around with Postman to test the API's.

### 4. Frontend App
Launch the frontend app locally.

* You can visit `http://localhost:8100` in your web browser to verify that the application is running. You should see a web interface.
